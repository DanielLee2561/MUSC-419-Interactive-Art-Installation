**Description**

- Software for interactive video and motion control at the 2024 UBC Bang! Festival.
- Deployed particle systems in Unity to generate ripples on water. Applied sensors with UDP networking to control position and strength by receiving motion data from ZigSim. Designed a custom shader for a day-night cycle skybox. This entailed modelling a finite state machine in C#, using lerp to interpolate cubemaps, and applying rotation to simulate movement.
